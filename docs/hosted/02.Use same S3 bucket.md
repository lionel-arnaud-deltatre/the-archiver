## Use the same project S3 for Soterus

If you want to use the same S3 bucket to deploy your builds + archiving with Soterus,
then provide the same S3 credentials to Soterus as the project.
(just remember to set `ARCHIVER_ROOT_FOLDER` correctly to define where to store the archives)

Example:
<link to tizen same s3>
