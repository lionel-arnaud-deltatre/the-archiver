## Everything you need to store your packaged build to Soterus

## What is going to happen
You will provide Soterus everything needed to store your build, then Soterus will:
- store the build that was just produced in the Vault
- check the available builds in the Vault for that specific combination (app/device/env)
- create/update the download worflow with the last 5 versions
- commit this workflow in the repository

## Providing all the parameters for the action

Actions available:
- store-folder-with-download
- store-file-with-download

### The build parameters ("with" part in the action)
 - actionType: <store a file or a folder>
 - version: <version of the build>                  (ie. "0.0.1")
 - appName: <name of the project>                   (ie. "Bell")
 - deviceType: <name of the device for this build>  (ie. "android")
 - environment: <name of the device for this build> (ie. "staging")
 - folderPath: <path where build files are>         (ie. "dist")    => needed for store-folder-with-download
 - filePath: <path where build files are>         (ie. "dist")      => needed for store-file-with-download

(i) Note that filePath can point to a specific file or a filetype:
 - filePath: "dist/bell_android_test_v2.0.0.apk"
 - filePath: "dist/*.apk"

(!) when using a wildcard with filePath, only the first file matching the wildcard will be archived
